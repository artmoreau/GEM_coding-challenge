This API was written to solve the [coding challenge](https://github.com/gem-spaas/powerplant-coding-challenge)

# How to launch :

To launch the API, you have to install python3 on your computer and then give a valid .json file as first argument to the main. Like this :

 - python main.py json_filename

As example, you can run :

 - python main.py payload1.json

That will create you a response_payload1.json file on the current directory.
